# Color-Quantization-AI-Project
||| In the name of Allah ||| <br />
---------------------------- <br />
Implementation of an Image Processing and a Python Machine Learning project: Color Quantization using K-Means clustering algorithm (with different k values) and OpenCV library. <br />
All functions and variables are written in a Python file (Color Quantizer - 400030490.py). <br />
Read the guides and explanations in the documentation file ...
# K-Means
K-means is a centroid-based or a distance-based algorithm, where we calculate the distances to assign a point to a cluster. In K-Means, each cluster is associated with a centroid. <br />
