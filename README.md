# Color-Quantization-AI-Project
 
||| In the name of Allah ||| <br />
---------------------------- <br />

Implementation of an Image Processing and a Python Machine Learning project: Color Quantization using K-Means clustering algorithm (with different k values) and OpenCV library. <br />
All functions and variables are written in a Python file (Color Quantizer - 400030490.py). <br />
Read the guides and explanations of this project in the documentation file ...

# K-Means Algorithm
K-means is an unsupervised machine learning method for clustering data points. <br />
Unsupervised learning in artificial intelligence is a type of machine learning that learns from data without human supervision. <br />
K-means is a centroid-based or a distance-based algorithm, where we calculate the distances to assign a point to a cluster. In K-Means, each cluster is associated with a centroid; the algorithm iteratively divides data points into K clusters by minimizing the variance in each cluster. <br />
